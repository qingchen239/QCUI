English Translated by Google | [繁體中文](./README.md)

## Feature Description

On some video sites in China, some of the original version of the flag of the Empire of Rising Sun will be reviewed and judged to be militaristic, leading to the removal of the video.

This MOD unifies the Japanese army flag in the original version as the Rising Sun Flag, which will greatly increase the review and approval rate of the vidoe and will not cause data unsynchronization during the battle.

## Instructions

1. Unzip the contents of the MOD file ("QCUI_'version number'.big" (such as "QCUI_1.0.big") and "QCUI_'version number'.skudef" (such as "QCUI_1.0.skudef)) Copy it to the game folder of "Red Alert 3".

2. Open the "RA3_'Language'\_1.12.SkuDef" (such as "RA3_chinese_t_1.12.SkuDef") file in the game folder with a file processing program, and insert "add-big QCUI_'version number'.big" in the second line (Such as "add-big QCUI_1.1.big") statement, and then save.

## Update log

1.0 Replaced the Japanese army flag on the Game Option screens, Mission Menu screens, Statistics screens, etc. and the Imperial Radar from the Japanese Army Flag to the Rising Sun Flag. 

1.1 Replace the Rising Sun Flag on the radar of the Empire State with a clearer version
