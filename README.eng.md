## Feature Description

On some video sites in China, some of the original version of the flag of the Asahi Empire will be reviewed and judged to be militaristic, leading to the removal of the film.

This MOD unifies the Asahi Empire flag in the original version as the "MTR Flag", which will greatly increase the review and approval rate of the film and will not cause data synchronization during the battle.

## Instructions

1. Combine the contents of the MOD file ("QCUI_version number.big" (such as "QCUI_1.0.big") and "QCUI_version number.skudef" (such as "QCUI_1.0.skudef) into two files) Copy it to the game folder of "Red Alert 3".

2. Open the "RA3_Language_1.12.SkuDef" (such as "RA3_chinese_t_1.12.SkuDef") file in the game folder with a file processing program, and insert "add-big QCUI_version number.big" in the second line (Such as "add-big QCUI_1.1.big") statement, and then save.

## Update log

1.0 Replaced the Asahi Empire flag on the battle room, battle suspension, battle settlement, etc. screens and the Imperial Radar from the Japanese Army Flag to the "MTR Flag"

1.1 Replace the "MTR flag" on the radar of the Empire State with a clearer version

## Existing problems

1. In the battle pause interface, random player flags will become allied flags. We have not yet found a solution to this problem.
